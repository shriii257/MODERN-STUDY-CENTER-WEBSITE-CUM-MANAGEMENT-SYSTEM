## 🗄️ DATABASE SETUP

### Step 1 — Create the database
1. Open **phpMyAdmin** (via your hosting control panel)
2. Click **New** → type database name: `ekagra_db` → click **Create**
3. Select `ekagra_db` from the left panel
4. Click **Import** tab → choose file `ekagra_db.sql` → click **Go**

### Step 2 — Note your credentials
- **Host:** Usually `localhost` (InfinityFree may give a specific hostname)
- **Database:** `ekagra_db`
- **Username:** *(from your hosting panel)*
- **Password:** *(from your hosting panel)*

---

## ⚙️ CONFIGURATION

Open `includes/db.php` and update the four constants:

```php
define('DB_HOST', 'localhost');       // Your MySQL host
define('DB_NAME', 'ekagra_db');      // Database name
define('DB_USER', 'your_username');  // MySQL username
define('DB_PASS', 'your_password');  // MySQL password
define('SITE_URL', 'https://yourdomain.com');
define('ADMIN_PHONE', '9999999999'); // Your phone number
```

Also update the phone numbers in `index.php`:
- Search for `+919999999999` and replace with your actual number

## 🚀 INFINITYFREE DEPLOYMENT STEPS

### Step 1 — Create hosting account
1. Go to **infinityfree.net** → Sign up free
2. Create a new hosting account → choose a subdomain or add your domain

### Step 2 — Upload files
**Option A: File Manager (recommended for beginners)**
1. Log in to InfinityFree control panel
2. Go to **File Manager** → open `htdocs` folder
3. Upload all project files maintaining the folder structure
4. Make sure `index.php` is directly inside `htdocs/`

**Option B: FTP**
1. Use FileZilla or similar FTP client
2. Credentials from InfinityFree control panel → FTP Accounts
3. Upload to `/htdocs/` directory

### Step 3 — Database on InfinityFree
1. InfinityFree control panel → **MySQL Databases**
2. Create a new database (name will be auto-prefixed, e.g. `epiz_12345_ekagra_db`)
3. Create a MySQL user and set a password
4. Assign the user to the database (All Privileges)
5. Import `ekagra_db.sql` via phpMyAdmin
6. Update `includes/db.php` with the exact credentials shown

### Step 4 — Set file permissions
- All PHP files: **644**
- All folders: **755**
- InfinityFree File Manager lets you right-click → Permissions

### Step 5 — Test
- Visit `https://yourdomain.com` — homepage should load

## 🛠️ COMMON ISSUES

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Blank page | Enable PHP error display — add `ini_set('display_errors', 1);` to `db.php` temporarily |
| DB connection error | Check credentials in `db.php`; InfinityFree uses a custom DB host |
| 500 error | Check `.htaccess` isn't blocking; InfinityFree has restrictions |
| Session not working | Some free hosts disable sessions — try a paid host for production |
| CSS not loading | Verify paths — make sure `assets/css/style.css` exists |

---
